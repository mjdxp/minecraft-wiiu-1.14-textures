# minecraft-wiiu-1.14-textures
A port of Minecraft PS4 Edition's new textures to Wii U Edition.

This mod replaces the terrain.png (and mipmap files) and items.png files in the Wii U Edition's files with the new textures, taken from PS4 Edition's files. Mobs, icons, etc. aren't changed from the original.

Installation instructions:
1. Install SDCafiine to your Aroma plugins folder: https://github.com/wiiu-env/sdcafiine_plugin
2. Copy the `wiiu` folder to the root of your SD card. If asked, merge the folders.
   Note: If you are not playing the USA version, you will have to rename the `00050000101D9D00` folder to one of the following:
   Europe: `00050000101D7500`
   Japan: `00050000101DBE00`
3. On game launch, SDCafiine will ask you which mod to load. Pick the "114textures" option.
4. The textures should be changed to the new ones. Enjoy!
